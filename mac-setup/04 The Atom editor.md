I use the Atom editor which provides a nice tool for not only editing the markdown content that we create, but it also integrates with GitHub making it easy to push content from your local copy to GitHub.

I am by no means an expert on Atom, but hopefully the instructions below will get you started.  There are lots of good web sites with documentation, just use google.

To install, simply go to <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">https://atom.io</a> and click the download button.

I also added the plugins to Atom that are found <a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/content/atom-markdown.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
