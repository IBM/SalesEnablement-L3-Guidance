# SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance
This repository provides guidance for creating Sales Enablement L3 Learning Plan content using Git Hub as a content repository and MkDocs to generate the end-user HTML and web site. 

The content provided here is based upon my personal experience in creating our first IBM Cloud platform Level 3 learning plan: (<a href="https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-7D757C8B58E7" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Satellite</a>).

Some of the content here is based upon the work Jeff Goodhue et al. did related to L3 creation for Sales Enablement.

There are 5 parts to this guidance which are accessible in the navigation to the left.

I'm sure there is more missing, but its a start.
