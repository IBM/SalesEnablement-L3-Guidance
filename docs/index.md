# SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance
This document is in DRAFT form.

This repository provides guidance for creating Sales Enablement L3 Learning Plan and content. The content provided here is based upon my pesonal experience in creating our first IBM Cloud platform Level 3 learning plan (<a> href="https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-7D757C8B58E7" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Satellitek</a>).
Some of the content here is based upon the work Jeff Goodhue has done related to L3 creation for Sales Enablement.  Jeff's presentation on the topic can be found on the <a> href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/getting-started-in-technology-sales" target="_blank">Getting Started in Technology Sales</a> under the Product eLearning section.

There are 3 parts to this guidance which are accessible in the navigation to the left.

Other topics that need to be covered:

- TechZone
- Video files (Watson Media or Seismic)
- best practices for content
- YL learning plan elements
- Stand & Delivers
- Quizzes
