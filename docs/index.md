# SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance
This repository provides guidance for creating IBM Cloud Sales Enablement L3 Learning Plan content using Git Hub as a content repository and MkDocs to generate the end-user HTML and web site. 

The content provided here is based upon my personal experience in creating our first IBM Cloud platform Level 3 learning plan.

In several chapters you will see a warning message like this:

    **These steps only need to be completed if you are creating a new L3 and working with a brand new repository. If you are modifying an existing L3 or playing with the test repository, you will not need to do these steps.**

You don't have to do these steps unless you are doing a brand new L3; however, I encourage you to read though these pages.

There are 5 parts to this guidance which are accessible in the navigation to the left.

I'm sure there is more missing, but its a start.
