# SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance
This repository provides guidance for creating Sales Enablement L3 Learning Plan content using Git Hub as a content repository and MkDocs to generate the end-user HTML and web site. 

The content provided here is based upon my personal experience in creating our first IBM Cloud platform Level 3 learning plan: (<a href="https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-7D757C8B58E7" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Satellite</a>).

Some of the content here is based upon the work Jeff Goodhue et al. did related to L3 creation for Sales Enablement.  Jeff's presentation on the topic can be found on the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/getting-started-in-technology-sales" target="_blank">Getting Started in Technology Sales</a> under the Product eLearning section.

There are 4 parts to this guidance which are accessible in the navigation to the left.

I'm sure there is more missing, but its a start.
