In creating the initial L3 for IBM Cloud Satellite, I followed guidance from Jeff Goodhue and others.  I've attempted to capture it all here, but this may need further testing.  If your run into issues, reach out to me (@andrewj in slack).

Instructions for both Mac and Windows are now included. Thanks to Connie West for helping with the Windows related installation information.

!!! Important "Things change!"

    The instructions here are a point in time. If you find things have changed (versions, steps, etc.), please open an issue in <a href="https://github.com/IBM/SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance" target="_blank">this git repository</a> or if you have write permission, update the docs for the next person.
