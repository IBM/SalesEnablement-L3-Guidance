We need to install both **git** and **GitHub Desktop**. 

## git


For MacOS:

1. Open a **terminal** window.
2. Try running the **git** command:

    ```
    git
    ```

3. If it is not already installed, a dialog will pop up to install it along with other developer tools. Follow the directions there to install. It will take a little time, but not the 40 minutes it initially says. If this doesn't occur, follow the directions below for Windows to install.

2. Scroll down and find the instructions for your platform (Windows or MacOS) and **follow the directions there**.

## GitHub Desktop

1. Using the the appropriate app store for your operating system, install GitHub Desktop. Search for **GitHub Desktop** in the appropriate app store and follow installation directions.
