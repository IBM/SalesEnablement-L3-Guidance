Git is probably already installed on your Mac.  Verify by opening a **terminal** and typing in **git**.  

If **git** is not already installed on your machine, follow the directions for your operating system<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">here</a>.

If this doesn't work for you, let me know and lets work to update these instructions (slack @andrewj).
