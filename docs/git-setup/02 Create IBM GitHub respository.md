**If you are just going to be updating a existing L3, you don't need to create a new repo.**

The creation of new repositories is automated, simple, and fast. If you are creating a new IBM Cloud L3, all you need to do is follow the steps below. 

1. Go to <a href="https://github.ibm.com/open-source/request-a-new-repo-bot" target="_blank">https://github.ibm.com/open-source/request-a-new-repo-bot</a>

2. Go to **Issues**

3. Click **New issue**

4. Click **Get started**

5. Complete the form. Just update the first 7 values in the form (remove teams, remove template).

Below are the values I used in creating this repository. Be sure and change the "users" field to your name. The **IBMSalesEnablement-TeamHybridCloud** is a GitHub team that I created for the IBM Cloud team.

```
* name: SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance
* users: andrewj2000
* teams: IBMSalesEnablement-TeamHybridCloud
* description: Sales Enablement guidance for creating L3 Learning PLans and content
* template: template_1 (*Optional*) **REMOVE THIS LINE IF NOT NEEDED**
* license: apache-2.0
* approval: yes
```

6. Click **Submit new issue**
7. Watch your email and follow the directions there.
