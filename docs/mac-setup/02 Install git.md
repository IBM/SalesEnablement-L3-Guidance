Git is probably already installed on your Mac.  Verify by opening a **terminal** and typing in **git**.  If not, check out the instructions found <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">here</a>.

If this doesn't work for you, let me know and lets work to update these instructions (slack @andrewj).
