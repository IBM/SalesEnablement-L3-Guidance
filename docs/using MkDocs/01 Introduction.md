If you have everything setup properly, you should be ready to try and create some markdown and to run a MkDocs build.

!!! tip
    MkDocs has a built in server so you can dynamically watch the updates you are making on your local copy of your repository as the content is saved.  I'm not going to document how to do that, but reference the MkDocs documentation for details.
