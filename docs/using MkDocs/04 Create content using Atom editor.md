You are ready to start creating content.  For this example we will keep it real simple.

1. Open the **Atom** editor.
2. In **Atom** create add new project folder using **File->Add Project Folder**

This will open a file dialog.  Select your IBM GitHub clone directory (e.g. **~/Documents/MKDOCS/SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance**).

The new project will appear in the left hand navigation.  If you expand it, you will see the **mkdocs.yml** file and **docs** directory.

At this point, you need to read the MkDocs user's guide for how to create content and update your **mkdocs.yml** file.  You can use <a href="https://github.com/IBM/SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance" target="_blank">repository</a> as an example.

As you modify your **mkdocs.yml** file and add content in your **docs** directory, you will notice on the left hand side of the **Atom** editor that **Unstaged Changes** are added when you save your work.  When you are ready, you can move those changes a Staging area by clicking the **Stage All** link.

If you are happy with those changes, you can commit them to your IBM GitHub repository by entering a **commit message** and clicking the **Commit to main** button.

Note: As a best practice you shoudl utilize brances, pull requests, etc. in **GitHub**.
