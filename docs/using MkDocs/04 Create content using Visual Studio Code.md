You are ready to start creating content.  For this example we will keep it real simple.

1. Open Visual Code Studio.
2. Click **File** and then **Open Folder**
3. Select your IBM GitHub clone directory (e.g. **~/Documents/MKDOCS/SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance**).
4. The folder will appear in the left hand navigation.  If you expand it, you will see the **mkdocs.yml** file and **docs** directory.

5. At this point, you need to read the MkDocs user's guide for how to create content and update your **mkdocs.yml** file.  You can use <a href="https://github.com/IBM/SalesEnablement-L3-Guidance" target="_blank">repository</a> as an example.

As you modify your **mkdocs.yml** file and add content in your **docs** directory, you will notice on the left hand side of **Visual Code Studio** that a count of the **Unstaged Changes** appear on the **Source Control** icon.  

6. When you are ready, you can commit the changes to your IBM GitHub repository by entering a **commit message** and clicking the **Commit** button.

Note: As a best practice you should utilize brances, pull requests, etc. in **GitHub**.
