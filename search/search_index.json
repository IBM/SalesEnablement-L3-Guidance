Their are many environments already built and collections that utilize them. The focus here is on IBM Cloud platform, so I'll relate how we created the environment and collection related to the IBM Cloud Satellite L3 learning plan. You can find the collection for the IBM Cloud Satellite L3 here . If an existing environment cannot be leveraged for your needs, you will want to create a custom request in the TechZone portal here . I don't know how long this typically takes as I worked through the process through past contacts in TechZone. The key pieces of work from an IBM Cloud platform perspective are: identify what you want to do and the resources required to do it decide if you want a shared enviornment where all users utilize the same cloud resources, or a dedicated enviroment where each user gets their own dedicated resources There are serveral factors that will go into deciding if you want a shared or * dedicated environment, such as: provisioning time required for resources costs associated with required resources complexity of defining a shared enviornment maintenance/monitoring of shared environments (what happens if someone corrupts a resource) For shared resources, the biggest issue was idenfitying the appropriate IAM permissions required to allow a user to productively use the environment and accomplish your goals and NOT be able to cause issues with the environment. For IBM Cloud Satellite, we defined both roles and policies that were common for all users and then very narrow policies that scope access to very specific resources (e.g. a namespace within Kubernetes clusters). While IBM Cloud documentation as a whole tends to be pretty good, some offerings still have work to go in documenting and implementing fine-grained access control with IAM. To get started in developing your TechZone environment, you should leverage existing content creation guidance available on the TechZone portal.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"creating%20content/01%20Introduction/","text":"It is strongly suggested you read through the MkDocs and Material theme documentation prior go building content. You can also leverage existing content as working examples like the IBM Cloud Satellite L3 content ( here ). A few suggestions: Videos There are several options for referencing videos in your content. Embed in content/repository - This is probably the simplest mechanism but there are limitations to the size of files in Git Hub. You can use tools like Handbrake to shrink video files. If you go this route, make sure you have the MkDocs videos plugin installed (mkdcos-video). Create a directory called _videos in your content folders and place videos there and reference using: ![type:video](./_videos/video.mp4) . Use Seismic, Watson Media, Youtube or other video streaming services - For videos tht are activities in Your Learning, you will probably want to use one these. You can also link to these videos in your content as well. Links When linking to external content, make sure you use target=\"_blank\" in your href. This will force the link to open in a new tab or window of the user's browser.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"git-setup/01%20Introduction/","text":"IBM's enterprise GitHub is used as the respoistory for our content.

I needed help with this and ran into a few issues. I'm not 100% sure if the instructions here are complete, but we can work through it on the next guinea pig. Once you have your IBM GitHub repository created, follow these instructions: Go to your IBM GitHub repositories Create a new branch called gh-pages Go to \"Settings->Pages\" Change the Source Settings to point to the root of your gh-pages branch Initial screen may look like this: You need to change the Source settings to look like below. Note, this may happen automatically when you create teh branch in step 2 above. Click the link for your published site. This will go to a new view of your README.md file that was created with your new IBM GitHub repository. Note, at this point the output here isn't real \"pretty\". Don't worry, this will change once we start using MkDocs. Return to your IBM GitHub repository in your browser (browser back button if you didn't open step 5 in a new window/tab). Verify the Pages build completed by viewing the Actions tab in your repository.","title":"Configure GitHub Pages"},{"location":"mac-setup/01%20Introduction/","text":"In creating the initial L3 for IBM Cloud Satellite, I followed guidance from Jeff Goodhue and others. I've attempted to capture it all here, but this may need further testing. If your run into issues, reach out to me (@andrewj in slack). Important I have only done this on a Mac.

I am by no means an expert on Atom, but hopefully the instructions below will get you started. There are lots of good web sites with documentation, just use google.

If you expand it, you will see the mkdocs.yml file and docs directory. At this point, you need to read the MkDocs user's guide for how to create content and update your mkdocs.yml file. You can use repository as an example. As you modify your mkdocs.yml file and add content in your docs directory, you will notice on the left hand side of the Atom editor that Unstaged Changes are added when you save your work. When you are ready, you can move those changes a Staging area by clicking the Stage All link. If you are happy with those changes, you can commit them to your IBM GitHub repository by entering a commit message and clicking the Commit to main button.
